NODE INTRODUCTION
02.9.2023

I read through the course support materials and the overall study path what is coming for us in the forthcoming course. I started reading on the Node and Express frameworks and watched the tutorial. I got some previous superficial experience on Node and Express from a couple of years ago so I got pretty good refresh on the subject. I haven't really worked with Heroku but it seems simple enough to be used in this course. I also set up my development environment on a windows development image so I am ready to start with the coding. I got also some experience with this set up process and git so it went pretty smoothly all things considered. 

MONGODB
03.09.2023
I took a closer look at the MongoDB. This is a first time I am looking at a non-SQL database in practice. I planned some of the overall database schemes that I could be using and I already see that the initial plans contain some repeated entries in the DB. For example tracking group memberships in user entries but also tracking user memberships in group entries at the same time. It certainly is a stupid way to go around but shows that further look into the non-SQL scheming best practices really need some attention.

PLANNING
04.9.2023

I planned some themes and high level functions that the final project should posses. I took some more accurate look on the express-handlebars template-engine and node/npm start scripts, production setups, directory structures, etc. I started to do a node/express/handlebars/mongodb skeleton model to represent the overall idea I had been planning. Tomorrow I planned to take a closer look on Angular and what new features and possibilities it could bring. I am especially interested of the differences and how they affect on the forthcoming project.
