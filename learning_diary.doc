LEARNING DIARY
 
EXAMPLE STYLE 1
10.9.2018

I checked the general information and understood the main focus of the course, which is to find my passion as a software developer and create a unique project to represent my skills. I chose frontend module because it was the most interesting project offered. I’ve also tried to set up my environment, but I could not decide which code editor I would like to use.  I learned to set up a git repository and did my first commit, everything went smoothly after I clicked the banner to watch intro to GIT.  
 
11.9.2018

I have chosen VS Code as my code editor for this course, I learned how to set up addons by googling how to do it. I searched the web for best addons and chose the best addons that I think fits me best.  I started to watch the first part of the example project to understand the technologies better.
 
I did my second commit but somehow it did not go as I planned. I went to stackoverflow and found quite many threads about version control problems. I was able to figure out what was the problem and continued to watch the first part till the end.

Etc.

Something else, but reasonable. You must document what you have done, learned and when this have happened.
